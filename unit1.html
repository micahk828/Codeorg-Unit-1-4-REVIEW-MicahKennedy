    <b>Unit 1: Digital Information</b>
      <hr>
      <p>In Unit 1, we started off learning about HTML and how it works. Our first vocabulary was webpage, website, website content, and website structure. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it's a language used to create web pages. An HTML element is a piece of a website, marked by a start tag and often closed with an end tag. We learned the basis of an HTML file which is !Doctype html, then html, then the head tag, and last the body. URL means uniform resource locator and href is hyper reference. You can add images to HTML with img (“image”): this tells HTML to include an image, src (“source”): says where to find the file, and alt (“alternate”): text that will be used if the file cannot be found. Types of images are apng, gif, ico, jpeg, png, svg, and more. We discussed number systems like the decimal number system, binary number system, and hexadecimal number system. Also, we went over sampling, layers of abstraction, compression, and creative commons.</p>

    <h1>Lesson 1: CFU</h1>
    <p><i>What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to
        the ones that you just heard about from other students?</i> --- I learn best through a variety of teaching
      styles and strategies. When teachers use mixes of teaching methods, it makes it more fun or engaging for me.
      Sometimes I like to just learn and do the work at home at my own pace because I can chill and get my work done. I
      see some similarities with the student named Jasmin D. because there are days when I don't get enough sleep and in
      the inactive classes, I find myself drifting asleep but I give myself something to do so I don't fall asleep.

    <h1>Lesson 2: CFU</h1>
    <p><i>Recall when you built your information sending device. Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of
        two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?</i> --- To start off with something
      simple as the prototype and then work our way up to a complex model.</p>
    </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
    <h1>Lesson 3: CFU</h1>
    <p><i>How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?</i> --- You would start
      off from the basics and show them how to count them after showing them basic numbers from the start.</p>
      </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
    <h1>Lesson 4: CFU</h1>
    <p><i>Two schools are merging and to adapt to the increased size of the student body, the school is changing its
        system for keeping track of all student IDs from a system that uses 4-bit binary numbers to one that uses 8-bit
        binary numbers (AKA 1 byte). Which of the following best describes what effect this change will have?</i> ---
      The 8-bit system will be able to represent sixteen times as many values as the 4-bit system.<br><i>Each time we
        add another bit, what happens to the amount of numbers we can make?</i> --- Each time we add another bit, the
      amount of numbers we can make multiples by 2.<br><i>How many bits would be needed to count all of the students in
        class today?</i> --- 5 bits.<br><i>What are the similarities and differences between the binary and decimal
        systems?</i> --- A binary system has only two digits (0 and 1) while a decimal number system has ten digits(0,
      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). Both systems are based on the position of the digits.</p>
        </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
    <h1>Lesson 5: CFU</h1>
    <p><i>Modern car odometers can record up to a million miles driven. What happens to the odometer reading when a car
        drives beyond its maximum reading?</i> --- When a car drives beyond its maximum reading, the odometer reading
      will start to overflow and malfunctions/errors can occur.<br><i>When using bits to represent fractions of a
        number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?</i> --- When using bits to represent fractions of
      a number, you can't create all possible fractions because you can only represent fractions that are powers of two
      in binary.</p>
          </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
    <h1>Lesson 7: CFU</h1>
    <p><i>Which of the following would result in a better digital approximation of an analog black and white image?</i>
      --- Decreasing the size of each sample square, thus increasing the number of samples taken.<br><i>Assume your
        friend just sent you 32 bits of pixel data (just the 0s and 1s for black and white pixels) that were encoded
        after sampling an image. Choose the two statements that are true.</i> --- The correct width and height must be
      input into the pixelation widget to produce the image. & The fact that only 32 bits were used to represent the
      image indicates relatively large sample squares were used. The digital image may vary from the analog image
      significantly.<br><i>Your computer science teacher asks you to sample a black and white image that is 4" x 6". How would you sample the image to provide a good digital approximation using the pixelation widget? What sample size would you use? How would your decision affect the digital representation?</i> --- When sampling a 4" x 6" black and white image using the pixelation widget, choose a sample size that balances detail and clarity. A smaller sample size captures more detail but requires more pixels, while a larger sample size reduces detail but uses fewer pixels. Your choice directly impacts the accuracy of the digital representation of the image.</p>
            </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
    <h1>Lesson 8: CFU</h1>
    <p><i>Which statement about analog and digital images is true?</i> ---  Sampling an analog image more frequently produces a digital image with a better representation.<br><i>Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.</i> --- Sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to turn a real image into a digital one. Sampling captures the image at intervals, RGB pixels show colors on the screen using red, green, and blue, and binary sequences store this data in bits to create the final digital color image.</p>
              </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
    <h1>Lesson 9: CFU</h1>
    <p><i>What is the most important quality of lossless compression?</i> --- The data is transformed to usually make it smaller. It can always be re-constructed back to the original.<br><i>An author is preparing to send their book to a publisher as an email attachment. The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider.If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?</i> --- I would tell the author that her file takes up a certain amount of digital space and that that space is still there but being downsized. Like if you folded paper. The paper looks smaller but its still there.</p>
                </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
    <h1>Lesson 10: CFU</h1>
    <p><i>You’ve been given a new cell phone with a 2 gigabyte data plan. You plan to use your phone for text messages, images, video, and music. Which of these categories are best compressed using lossless compression? Which of these categories are best compressed using lossy compression? Why?</i> --- For text messages, images, and music, it's best to use lossless compression because it retains all the original data without any loss. This is important for maintaining quality in these types of content. On the other hand, videos are best compressed using lossy compression as it sacrifices some details to reduce file size significantly, which is ideal for efficient storage and streaming.</p>
                  </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
    <h1>Lesson 11: CFU</h1>
    <p><i>How is a Creative Commons license different from a regular copyright?</i> ---  It allows your work to be shared, reused, and remixed to help spark more creativity.<br><i>As a reminder, in the warm-up we saw this scenario:
Imagine you were using some of our pixelation tools to create an image and you posted it online for your friends to see - but, a week later you find out someone took that image and put it on a T-shirt that they’re selling for $10 each.</i> --- To make the scenario of someone using your image on a T-shirt for sale acceptable, you would need to give permission, set clear licensing terms, require attribution, and potentially establish a commercial use agreement.</p>
                    </div><div class="waver" id="us1">
    <h1>Lesson 12: CFU</h1>
    <p><i>Many museums have digital catalogs of their collections. What are the potential benefits and harms of creating these digital catalogs?</i> --- Digital catalogs offer accessibility, analytics, and cost-effectiveness but may lead to attention span issues, market research challenges, technical complexities, and copyright concerns for museums.<br><i>Why should we care about information being represented digitally? How does this impact you personally?</i> --- Digital representation is essential because it allows information to be easily transferred, stored, and manipulated. Personally, it affects how we engage with music, media, and technology. For example, in music, digital notation ensures accurate preservation of compositions. In media, it influences empathy and self-perception. Technically, digital data enables efficient processing, transmission, and storage due to its binary nature. It also enhances communication systems by enabling error detection and correction. Overall, digital representation is crucial for modern life, impacting how we consume media, communicate, and innovate technologically.</p>
