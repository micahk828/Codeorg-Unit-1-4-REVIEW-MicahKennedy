  <b>Unit Summaries</b>
  <div class="wave" id="u1">
    <b>Unit One</b>
    <hr>
    <p>In Unit 1, we started off learning about HTML and how it works. Our first vocabulary was webpage, website, website content, and website structure. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and it's a language used to create web pages. An HTML element is a piece of a website, marked by a start tag and often closed with an end tag. We learned the basis of an HTML file which is !Doctype html, then html, then the head tag, and last the body. URL means uniform resource locator and href is hyper reference. You can add images to HTML with img (“image”): this tells HTML to include an image, src (“source”): says where to find the file, and alt (“alternate”): text that will be used if the file cannot be found. Types of images are apng, gif, ico, jpeg, png, svg, and more. We discussed number systems like the decimal number system, binary number system, and hexadecimal number system. Also, we went over sampling, layers of abstraction, compression, and creative commons.</p>

    <b>Unit Two</b>
    <hr>
    <p>In Unit 2, we started off learning about types of networks which are centralized and distributed. The five main types of computer networks are LAN (Local Area Network), PAN (Personal Area Network), MAN (Metropolitan Area Network), WAN (Wide Area Network),and VPN (Virtual Private Network). Key vocabulary from this unit were path, bandwidth, protocol, IP address, router, redundancy, fault tolerance, packet, datastream, packet metadata, and digital divide. We also learned about protocols on the internet like User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), Domain Name System (DNS), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). </p>
  </div>
  <div class="wave" id="u3">
    <b>Unit Three</b>
    <hr>
    <p>In Unit 3, we got introduced to App Design. We learned what functionality was and how to identify it in an app. Key vocabulary was input, output, user interface (UI), sequential programming, event-driven programming, documentation, comment, program, program statement, command runs, debugging, and pair programming. We learned how to properly communicate instructions to colleagues, how to develop easily understandable instructions, how to plan out the design of an app, sequential vs event-driven programming, and how to debug. The steps for debugging are to describe the problem, hunt for bugs, try solutions, and then document.</p>

  <div class="wave" id="u4">
    <b>Unit Four</b>
    <hr>
    <p>In Unit 4, the topic was variables, functions, and conditionals. Numbers and strings are two different types of values and expressions evaluate to a single new value. Key vocabulary were expression, assignment operator, variable, string, data abstraction, pseudocode, abstraction, procedure, procedure call, mechanics, boolean value, comparison operators, conditional statement, logical operators, function (procedure), and function call. In JavaScript, // symbolizes the start of a comment and they have no effect on the code. There are two types of variables: global which is permanent and can be used anywhere in your code & local which is temporary and can only be used in a function / specific set of text. A variable is the placeholder of a single piece of data, whether it’s a number, words, etc. Boolean values are a type of information, so they can also be evaluated in a Boolean expression using logical operators. An algorithm is a sequence of well-defined instructions used to solve a problem or perform an action. Procedural abstraction is the process of taking shared features in several algorithms and making one procedure to use over and over again. Heuristics is an approach to problem solving that is not guaranteed to be optimal or efficient, but works when other solutions will not work. A pixel is a single physical point in a raster image and it’s the smallest part of the actual screen, made up of squares. Simulations are virtual representations that allow you to experience many possible outcomes to a real-life scenario. When you create variables you should use var only once and create your variables at the top of your program. This keeps your code organized and easier to read for you and others. One of the major skills we built in this unit was making flowcharts to represent if statements.</p>
